## üìä What Remains

### Core Functionality
- ‚úÖ On-demand report generation (afternoon, night, custom)
- ‚úÖ Slack integration for sending reports
- ‚úÖ Aircall API integration
- ‚úÖ Health checks and monitoring
- ‚úÖ API documentation (Swagger)
- ‚úÖ Prometheus metrics
- ‚úÖ Scheduled report generation
- ‚úÖ JWT authentication
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting and security

### Available Endpoints
- `GET /health` - Health check
- `GET /status` - Service status
- `POST /report/afternoon` - Afternoon report
- `POST /report/night` - Night report
- `POST /report/custom` - Custom time range report
- `GET /report/today` - Today's report
- `GET /scheduler/status` - Scheduler status
- `POST /scheduler/start` - Start scheduler
- `POST /scheduler/stop` - Stop scheduler
- `POST /scheduler/trigger/afternoon` - Manual afternoon trigger
- `POST /scheduler/trigger/night` - Manual night trigger
- `GET /scheduler/next-runs` - Next scheduled runs
- `GET /test-connections` - Test service connections
- `GET /api-docs` - API documentation
- `GET /metrics` - Prometheus metrics

### Database Models
- `Report.js` - For storing report history
- `SyncStatus.js` - For tracking sync status (if needed for other features)

## üéØ Impact

### Positive Changes
- **Simplified Architecture**: Removed complex data aggregation and storage
- **Reduced Complexity**: Fewer moving parts and dependencies
- **Cleaner Codebase**: Focus on core reporting functionality
- **Better Performance**: No background sync jobs consuming resources
- **Easier Maintenance**: Less code to maintain and debug

### Functionality Preserved
- All core reporting features remain intact
- Slack integration continues to work
- Aircall API integration preserved
- Monitoring and observability features maintained
- API documentation updated and accurate

## üöÄ Next Steps

The service is now streamlined and focused on its core purpose:
1. **On-demand reporting** from Aircall to Slack
2. **Scheduled reporting** with configurable schedules
3. **Health monitoring** and observability
4. **API documentation** and testing

The removal of hourly call stats functionality makes the service more focused, maintainable, and easier to deploy and operate.

## üîç Verification

All references to hourly call stats functionality have been verified as removed:
- ‚úÖ No remaining imports
- ‚úÖ No remaining route registrations
- ‚úÖ No remaining service initializations
- ‚úÖ No remaining database model references
- ‚úÖ Documentation updated
- ‚úÖ API endpoints cleaned up

The service is now ready for deployment with a cleaner, more focused architecture.
